In the first week of February 2022 we've witnessed a more serious tentative of Bitcoin to decouple from traditional stock markets,
especially Nasdaq to which it was highly correlated lately (both crashed pretty bad in January).
While the latter suffered a major retreat still at the end of the week, Bitcoin held quite well, to even pump over the weekend.

Our tip - "C'mon Bitcoin you can do it, choose the way to freedom and liberate yourself from the traditional markets!
Be the king asset class!".
