## About ₿🏃🎨

**Everybody** is aware of the formidable runs bitcoin had in the last decade. At [BitcoinRun.Art](https://www.bitcoinrun.art)
 we want to make **every body** and **soul** aware of bitcoin ₿, running benefits ❤️  and art 🎨 . 
 
 **How?** By running Bitcoin shaped routes and drawing them on navigation maps.
 Our pace (🏃) and heart beat (💓) give the colors of the run:
