My second bitcoin run was in [C√¢mpulung Muscel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%C3%A2mpulung),
 the town closest to my ‚ù§Ô∏è and where I grew up in:

It took me around an hour for around 8.2 km:

Funny enough, once a year when I come back to C√¢mpulung, I walk more or less the same route as this Bitcoin Run, and I take pictures.
Here are some pictures from this particular bitcoin run.  
 
## Bitcoin Run City Tour Pictures

As usual, I stopped at some of Campulung's points of interested to take pictures. You can see all of them
if you click on the photo icon in the following map:

More about the individual places in the paragraphs below üëá

The start point is at [Casa de culturƒÉ Tudor Mu»ôatescu (en. "Culture House Tudor Mu»ôatescu")](https://www.casadecultura-muscel.ro/),
 a place I passed by like millions of times in my life

Vis-√†-vis, at the northern end of the Pardon Boulevard (currently closed for renovations),
 I run by [Biserica Sfantu Nicolae (en. St. Nicholas Church)](https://goo.gl/maps/tNzspc4Pshks2iNM7),
  the place where I got married and baptized my smaller son in:

50m further north you can find the oldest hotel in town ["Hotel Muscelul"](https://www.muscelul.ro/), 
sadly still a reminder of [communist times](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socialist_Republic_of_Romania).
 This is where I had the party after baptizing my smaller son:

Across the road from the hotel you can find the best "merdenele" (cheese pastry) in town, some say in the country,
 at ["Patiseria Iepura»ôul" (en. Bunny Pastry)](https://www.iepurasul.ro/)
 
<figure class="image">

Next to the pastry you can visit the [City Museum](https://muzeulcampulung.ro/), to learn about the [town's history](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%C3%A2mpulung)
and see some old weapons and stuffed animals:

50m further you can see the **Piata centralƒÉ** (en. Central Square) and the town hall:

The [town hall](https://www.primariacampulung.ro/), a closer look:

On top of the **B** I cross the first bridge on my run, from which you can see **V√¢rful Mateia»ô** (en. Mateia»ô Summit).
 This is where some bloody fights took place in the first world war. You can visit there the [Mausoleul de la Mateia»ô](https://ro.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mausoleul_de_la_Mateia%C8%99),
a place dedicated to those fallen in battle:

I found this small church hidden behind the biggest buildings of the town

Half way on my run I reach one of my dearest view points, where you can a panoramic view on the town and surrounding 
mountains

Behind you can see the highest hill in Romania, MƒÉ»õƒÉu (1017 m)

Going little further down the B, I leave behind the [Biserica FlƒÉm√¢nda (en. FlƒÉm√¢nda Church)](https://goo.gl/maps/TWunEpXQ3a6ybQm87)

<figure class="image">

  <figcaption>Biserica FlƒÉm√¢nda</figcaption>

In the down right corner of B I pass by the high school I attended and spent four wonderful years in, Dinicu Golescu High School:

<figure class="image">

  <figcaption>Dinicu Golescu High School</figcaption>
</figure>
  

Next to Dinicu Golescu High School, I took a peek at the [Negru VodƒÉ Monastery](https://ro.wikipedia.org/wiki/M%C4%83n%C4%83stirea_Negru_Vod%C4%83),
 from 14th century:

On the way back to city center I pass by the Grand Royal Hotel, an architectural masterpiece, left unfortunately to the forces
of degradation

Close to the Pardon Boulevard there is the public garden Merci, built in 1885. It is close to my parents house, 
and it has also a playground where I hang out with my kids sometimes:

Nearing the end of my bitcoin run I pass the last bridge, and I take a last picture.
 I used to bathe in R√¢ul T√¢rgului (en. Town's River) when I was little and in Cre»õulescu Park I used to ride my back in:

This is probably the most emotional and to me the most valuable bitcoin. C√¢mpulung has still a lot of hidden gems, the cleanest
 air in Romania and I hope you want to discover it by now.
