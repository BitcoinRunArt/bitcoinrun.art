My second run in Switzerland was in another of my favorites cities in Switzerland, namely in Lucerne.
 It took me around half an hour minutes at a really slow pace, as I stopped a lot to admire the beautiful old sights
 and architecture along the way:

## Bitcoin Run City Pictures 

As mentioned before, I made many stops to take photos of some of Lucerne's most well-known attractions.
You see the points where I took the pictures, if you click on the camera icon in the map below:

Let's find out more now about the individual places I took pictures of ðŸ‘‡

### Start of the run in a residential area 

The start point is in a residential area close to city center with very beautiful buildings and architecture:

### Franciscan church

</figure>

Shortly after I pass by the Franciscan Church, which "was erected between 1270 and 1280 by Franciscan monks,
who occupied the site in Lucerne until 1838. The building's medieval architecture is typical of that favoured
by this mendicant order of monks."[^1]

### Chapel Bridge and Water Tower

A couple of hundred meters further I reach the main attraction area of the city. The Chapel Bridge and its Water Tower
are Lucerne's landmarks and most photographed destination.[^2]

### Jesuit Church

From the same point if you look back the Reus river you can see the **Jesuit Church**. "Construction of the church began in 1666,
with the official inauguration being held in 1677. The Jesuit Church was modelled on the Church of the GesÃ¹ in Rome
as the first major sacred building to be built in the baroque style in Switzerland. In terms of art,
particularly worth noting are its baroque and rococo stucco, its high altar, and its organ and treasury. The imposing interior
boasts a particularly fine acoustic, which is why the church now also serves as a concert venue; organists are also taught here." [^3]

### Picturesque Old Town squares

#### Town-hall clock

Across the Reuss river over the Rathaussteg I reach the old town, with the **Town-hall clock** at the entry. 
"The town-hall of Lucerne on the Kornmarkt was built between 1602 and 1606 by the Italian architect Anton Isenmann
from the Prismell region and is valued as a masterpiece of late Renaissance style.
The tower of the town-hall is older and was erected in the High Middle Ages,
later serving as a dungeon and finally housing the town-hall clock."[^4]

The car-free old town has lots of pitoresque squares, which are peppered with historic, fresco-adorned houses. Look up
and you will discern a wealth of architectural, elaborate and historico-cultural details.[^5] It was really worth
deviating from the planned B shape route. See for yourself ðŸ‘‡

#### Weinmarkt 

One of the squares is "the neat Weinmarkt, where the citizens of Lucerne 1332 swore an oath of allegiance
to the federation formed by Uri, Schwyz and Unterwalden. Until the middle of the 16th century, the Weinmarkt was the fish market.
The demolition of the two-storey wooden market hall, where meat, bread and leather had been traded,
led in 1841 to the emergence of the square in its present form."[^5]

### Hirschenplatz

Houses on Hirschenplatz also feature fascinating ornamented facades, which are under historical monument protection:

  <figcaption>Spreuer Bridge</figcaption>
</figure>


"As well as the Chapel Bridge, Lucerne is home to another timber bridge of great interest.
Located slightly downstream of the Chapel Bridge, the Spreuer Bridge does not enjoy such a high profile.
Though somewhat shorter and less dominant in appearance, in every other aspect it is its Â«big sister'sÂ» equal.

Its name comes from the word Â«SpreuÂ», meaning chaff: the town's flour mills were permitted to dump their waste into
the River Reuss from this bridge. Built in 1408, the southern half is perpendicular to the River Reuss,
while the northern portion veers off at an angle."[^6]

[^6]: <https://www.luzern.com/en/highlights/sights/spreuer-bridge/>

From the Spreuer Bridge you can see on the upper side some part of the Musegg Wall and it nine towers:

  </a>
  <figcaption>Spreuer Bridge</figcaption>
</figure>

> "Once a symbol of power, the Musegg Wall and its nine towers are part of Lucerne's historic fortifications;
> forming a striking crown around the Old Town, the wall can be discerned from afar."[^7]


[^7]: <https://www.luzern.com/en/highlights/sights/musegg-wall/>

You can walk on the wall, and from there you have a beautiful view on the city, the lake and on the surrounding mountains.
The following two pictures were taken in one of my previous visits with the family in Lucerne.

If you look down the Reuss river from the Spreuer Bridge you can see the Jesuit Curch[^3] from another perspective:

### Chapel Bridge and Water Tower from another perspective

I conclude the Bitcoin Run in Lucerne with another perspective on the Chapel Bridge and Water Tower[^4]

In summer they decorate the bridges with flowers, which makes them even more attractive. See a picture below from yet
another of my visits to Lucerne:

I hope you got a glimpse of how Lucerne is, but as always I recommend you pay a visit there by yourself. It's worth it.
