My second run in Switzerland was in my second favorite city in Switzerland, namely in Lucerne.
 It took me around half an hour minutes at a really slow pace, as I stopped a lot to admire the beautiful old sights
 and architecture along the way:

[The Town-hall clock (german RatHaus Uhr)](https://turmuhrenluzern.ch/en/project/rathaus-uhr/)
"The town-hall of Lucerne on the Kornmarkt was built between 1602 and 1606 by the Italian architect Anton Isenmann
from the Prismell region and is valued as a masterpiece of late Renaissance style.
The tower of the town-hall is older and was erected in the High Middle Ages later serving as a dungeon and finally
housing the town-hall clock."

Spreuer Bridge
"As well as the Chapel Bridge, Lucerne is home to another timber bridge of great interest.
Located slightly downstream of the Chapel Bridge, the Spreuer Bridge does not enjoy such a high profile.
Though somewhat shorter and less dominant in appearance, in every other aspect it is its Â«big sister'sÂ» equal.

Its name comes from the word Â«SpreuÂ», meaning chaff: the town's flour mills were permitted to dump their waste into
the River Reuss from this bridge. Built in 1408, the southern half is perpendicular to the River Reuss,
while the northern portion veers off at an angle."

## Bitcoin Run City Pictures 

As mentioned before, I made many stops to take photos of some of Lucerne's most well-known attractions.
You see the points where I took the pictures, if you click on the camera icon in the map below:

Let's find out more now about the individual places I took pictures of ðŸ‘‡

The start point is in a residential area close to city center with very beautiful buildings and architecture:

Shortly after I pass by the Franciscan Church, which "was erected between 1270 and 1280 by Franciscan monks, who occupied the site in Lucerne until 1838.
The building's medieval architecture is typical of that favoured by this mendicant order of monks."[^1]

Right after the Casino Square, I pass besides the [Zytglogge (Zeitglockenturm)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zytglogge),
 the famous clock tower, that [inspired Albert Einstein](https://www.bbc.com/travel/article/20160901-the-clock-that-changed-the-meaning-of-time)
when writing his theory of relativity

Before heading down to the river, I pass by the [city theater](https://www.bern.com/en/detail/bern-city-theater) 
in Kornhausplatz (en. Granary Square) 
used to admire when writing his theory of relativity

Turn right and take the stairs down to the [Aare river](https://www.bern.com/en/detail/the-aare-river) and pass the river
over the [Altenbergsteg Suspension Bridge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Altenbergsteg) where this picture of the river
is taken from
used to admire when writing his theory of relativity

When turning around to finish the bangs of the letter B, I could have a good look at both the KornhausbrÃ¼cke (en.  Granary Bridge)
 and the suspension bridge

After running along the Aare for like a kilometer, I turn with the river and get to see the
 [UntertorbrÃ¼cke (German: Lower Gate Bridge)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Untertorbr%C3%BCcke),
 [Nydeggkirche](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nydeggkirche)

another church, I was not aware of before
