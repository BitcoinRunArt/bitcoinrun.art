### Predigerkirche

"Predigerkirche is one of the four main churches of the old town of Zürich, Switzerland, besides Fraumünster,
Grossmünster and St. Peter. First built in 1231 AD as a Romanesque church of the then Dominican Predigerkloster, the
Basilica was converted in the first half of the 14th century, the choir between 1308 and 1350 rebuilt, and a for that
time unusual high bell tower was built, regarded as the highest Gothic edifice in Zürich. As Spain converted all Mosques
to churches and all Minarets to bell towers, bell towers were built all over Europe, the Minarets in Spain were built by
Almohads a north Africa dynasty, Mesquita tower in Cordoba, Geralda tower in Seville and Koutoubia in Marrakech"[^4]

### Fraumünster Church

"The Fraumünster and Grossmünster churches are landmarks of Zurich. The convent once held great power in Zurich. Founded
in 853 by King Louis the German, this church with its convent was inhabited by the female members of the aristocracy of
Europe. The convent enjoyed the patronage of kings and the abbess the right to mint coins in Zurich until well into the
13th century. Ownership of the church and convent passed to the city of Zurich after the Reformation."[^6]
