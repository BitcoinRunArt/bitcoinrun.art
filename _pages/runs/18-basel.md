### St. Johanns-Tor

which formed part of the fortifications built shortly after the great earthquake of 1356. "[^2]

### Old tram in the city center

So as in Zürich, Basel has also many trams in the city center[^3]. I like the old ones, they are so cute.

### City Hall 

"The City Hall is the seat of the Basel government and its parliament. 
In the midst of the Old Town, it is particularly eye catching with its red facade,
the characteristic tower and playful frescoes."[^4]

### Mittlere Brücke

"Hardly another monument in the city of Basel has become such a symbol of the city as the Mittlere Brücke.
Opened in 1226, it is one of the oldest Rhine crossings between Lake Constance and the North Sea."[^5]

"The Käppelijoch is a small Gothic chapel on the Mittlere Brücke that was once both a religious site on the bridge,
and the scene of public punishments." [^6]

### View On Basler Muenster from Mittlere Brücke

"Together with the Mittlere Brücke, the Basler Münster (Cathedral) is probably the most famous landmark in Basel.
With its red sandstone walls, colourful roof tiles and twin towers,
no other building adorns the cityscape of Basel like the Cathedral" [^7]

### View on Mittlere Brücke from the Rhein level

In the backround you can see the Martinskirche. "The Martinskirche on Münsterhügel (Cathedral Hill) is the oldest parish church in Basel.
Once the site of religious services, it has now become Basel’s most important concert church
due to its outstanding acoustics." [^8]

### Johanniter Brücke south view with Roche Towers

"The Roche Towers, designed by architects Herzog & de Meuron, can rightly be viewed as a modern landmark of Basel
– but as the tallest office buildings in Switzerland, they can be seen far outside the city limits, too.."[^9]
