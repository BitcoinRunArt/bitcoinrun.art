### Stairs to Giardino di Boboli

"The Boboli Gardens (Italian: Giardino di Boboli) is a historical park of the city of Florence that was opened to the public in 1766.
Originally designed for the Medici, it represents one of the first and most important examples of the Italian garden,
which later served as inspiration for many European courts. The large green area is a real open-air museum with statues
of various styles and periods, ancient and Renaissance that are distributed throughout the garden.
It also has large fountains and caves, among them the splendid Buontalenti grotto built by the artist, architect,
and sculptor Bernardo Buontalenti between 1536 and 1608."[^10]
