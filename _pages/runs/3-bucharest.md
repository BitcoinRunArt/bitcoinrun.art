My third bitcoin run was in [Bucharest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bucharest), the capital city of Romania,
 where I studied and worked for eight years.

This bitcoin run took me around one and a half hours for around 12.8 km. Trying to avoid the air pollution, my pace
was sub-medium for this run:

Let's now see some Bucharest' attractions along on my bitcoin run. 
 
## Bitcoin Run City Tour Pictures
 
The start point is at [Pia»õa UniversitƒÉ»õii (en. "University Square")](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_Square,_Bucharest)
right in the city center. Some tragic events took place here at and [shortly after](https://ro.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golaniada)
 the [Romanian Revolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romanian_Revolution)

Right next to the Pia»õa UniversitƒÉ»õii, you find the [National Theatre Bucharest](https://www.tnb.ro/en):

and the five star ["Hotel Intercontinental"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/InterContinental_Bucharest)

At the other end of [Bulevardul Magheru (en. Magheru Boulevard)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulevardul_Magheru) 
I reach the [Pia»õa RomanƒÉ (en. Roman Square)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pia%C8%9Ba_Roman%C4%83), a major traffic
intersection, with [Bucharest Academy of Economic Studies (ro. Academia de Studii Economice - ASE)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bucharest_Academy_of_Economic_Studies)
 "watching" over it:

Close to Pia»õa RomanƒÉ, at the tip of the B bangs, I have found the statue of a [dacian nobleman](https://goo.gl/maps/WnDs1HcjYuu7NPnCA):

> [Dacia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dacia) was the land inhabited by the [Dacians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dacians), 
the romanian ancestors. Nowadays the name "Dacia" is better known for the [romanian car manufacturer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automobile_Dacia). 

At the end of the first B loop I have found [Foi»ôorul de Foc (literally The Fire Tower)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foi%C8%99orul_de_Foc),
 which is a 42-metre-high building and was used in the past as an observation tower by the firemen:

At [Parcul Izvorul Rece](https://goo.gl/maps/ZVQzLNUMKioEtNrz9), half-way on the bitcoin run,
 I was in doubt whether I should continue, because I was 
getting tired and had some place I had to go, but I pushed on and completeed the bitcoin run

Passing Pia»õa UniversitƒÉ»õii again, but now going south on [Bulevardul Ion C. BrƒÉtianu](https://ro.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulevardul_Ion_C._Br%C4%83tianu,_Bucure%C8%99ti)
 I reach [Pia»õa Unirii (en. "Union Square")](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pia%C8%9Ba_Unirii). This is one of the largest squares
 in Central Bucharest and a significant transport hub:
 
<figure class="image">

  </a>
  <figcaption>Pia»õa Unirii</figcaption>
</figure>

At the end of [Bulevardul Unirii (en. "Union Boulevard")](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulevardul_Unirii),
 at [Pia»õa Constitu»õiei (Romanian for "Constitution Square")](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pia%C8%9Ba_Constitu%C8%9Biei)
 you can see the [Palace of the Parliament (Romanian: Palatul Parlamentului),
 also known as the Republic's House (Casa Republicii) or People's House (Casa Poporului)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palace_of_the_Parliament)
 
<figure class="image">

> The Palace of the Parliament in Bucharest is believed to be
> [the heaviest building in the world](https://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/world-records/heaviest-building/).

A closer look reveals it's a massive building:

I continue my bitcoin run along the [D√¢mbovi»õa River](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D%C3%A2mbovi%C8%9Ba_(river)), where
a couple of fishermen pass their time

> I have very nice memories spending my summers as child on D√¢mbovi»õa's shores in [Comuna Stoene»ôti](https://ro.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comuna_Stoene%C8%99ti,_Arge%C8%99)  

On the river's shore you can also find the [Romanian National Library](https://www.cenl.org/library/national-library-of-romania/):

When I want to pay the parking ticket, I was pleasantly surprised to find this Bitcoin Machine where you 
can buy bitcoins:

All in all, Bucharest is definitely worth a run or visit - give it a try!
