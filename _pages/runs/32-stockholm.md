### Photos from the run 📷

Stockholm is a stunning city, full of museums, historical buildings, and beautiful architecture.
I found myself stopping frequently to take photos. Here are a few of them 📷👇

#### Start of the run further away from the city center

Though further away from the city center, you notice the nice architecture everywhere

### Stockholm City Hall

What I though initially was a church, turned out to be the [city hall of Stockholm](https://stadshuset.stockholm/en/visit-stockholm-city-hall/)
"The City Hall is one of Sweden’s most prominent examples of buildings constructed in the national romantic style."

### Nice buildings with Monarch Church in the background

Close to the city hall, you can see some nice buildings with the Riddarholmen Church in the background.
"[Riddarholmen Church](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riddarholmen_Church) is the church of the former medieval Greyfriars Monastery in Stockholm, Sweden.
The church serves as the final resting place of most Swedish monarchs."

### Me with the Royal Palace in the background and Parliament House on the right

The [Stockholm Palce](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stockholm_Palace)
or the Royal Palace is the official residence of the Swedish monarch. 
It is situated close to the swedish [Parliament House](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament_House,_Stockholm).
