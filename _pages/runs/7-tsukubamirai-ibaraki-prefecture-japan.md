Bitcoin Runs has reached Asia for the first time, in [Tsukubamirai](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tsukubamirai,_Ibaraki),
[Ibaraki Prefecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ibaraki_Prefecture), Japan 🇯🇵,
thanks to the athlete and gps artist [Tetsunori Murachi](https://www.instagram.com/tettsu777/). He drew a Bitcoin Run
in his favorite "canvas" area, around the [Miraidaira Station](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miraidaira_Station)
