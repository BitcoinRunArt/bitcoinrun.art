In October 2021, Bitcoin put a nice 40% price gain, and the technology acceptance continued its growth. 
It was a truly ["golden october"](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goldener_Oktober) for bitcoin. 

More importantly, people are starting to recognise that Bitcoin structures energy, it makes unbreakable and easily transferable:

To recharge my batteries and celebrate October I did a run, well more a walk, in the woods to and recharge my batteries.
 Autumn, october is just amazing, colorwise:
