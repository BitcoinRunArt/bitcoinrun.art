In the realm of Bitcoin, the number 21 holds profound significance,
representing the ultimate cap of 21 million bitcoins to be mined, highlighting the concept of scarcity within the ecosystem.
With the 21st BitcoinRun, we celebrate not only this numerical milestone but also the incredible proof of work
by athletes worldwide who have contributed their energy to this endeavor. 
Just as Bitcoin's proof of work mechanism requires computational energy, the creation of GPS art by athletes parallels this,
showcasing the fusion of physical and digital energies in innovative ways.
We extend our heartfelt gratitude to all participants for their dedication and enthusiasm, as their energy has made these runs possible 🔥:
